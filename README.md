## Install

Paste this into a terminal — it downloads the latest release and installs it:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMitchell-GitHub/gnome-claude-monitor/main/online-install.sh | bash
```

Then **load it** by reloading GNOME Shell:

- **X11:** press `Alt`+`F2`, type `r`, press `Enter` (your windows stay open)
- **Wayland:** log out and back in

That's it — look for the 🤖 in your top bar. Not sure which one you're on? Run
`echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`.

<summary><b>Other ways to install</b> (release zip, or from source)</summary>

**From a release zip**

1. Grab `claude-usage.shell-extension.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/AMitchell-GitHub/gnome-claude-monitor/releases/latest).
2. `gnome-extensions install --force claude-usage.shell-extension.zip`
3. Reload the shell (see above), then `gnome-extensions enable claude-usage@aidan.local`.

**From source**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AMitchell-GitHub/gnome-claude-monitor.git
cd gnome-claude-monitor
./install.sh        # copies into place + compiles the schema + enables
```

## What you need

- **GNOME Shell 48** (X11 or Wayland)
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** installed and signed in — the extension reads its local files

## What it shows

The top bar stays compact: `🤖 1/3 │ ⏱ 13% · 4h13m` — running/total sessions (the count
turns orange when one is working), then your 5-hour usage and reset countdown.

Click it for the full picture:

- **Sessions** — one row per live session: project name, busy/idle dot, uptime, and
  **that session's token usage** (per-agent tokens over the last ~26h; hidden once a
  session has been idle longer than that)
- **Usage** — 5h window (% bar + reset countdown), weekly window (% + reset + any
  model-specific Opus/Sonnet limits), your plan tier, and today's tokens
- **Status line** — e.g. `Updated 12s ago · source: api`, or in red `⚠ Pull failed: HTTP 429`
- **Refresh now** — force an immediate update

**Settings:** pick where it sits in the top bar (left / center / right, plus position) —
changes apply live. Open them any time with `gnome-extensions prefs claude-usage@aidan.local`.

## Your data stays on your machine

| Shown | Where it comes from |
|-------|---------------------|
| Sessions + busy/idle status | `~/.claude/sessions/*.json` (filtered to live PIDs via `/proc`) — local |
| 5h + weekly usage % and reset | `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` — the same endpoint Claude Code's `/usage` and claude.ai/settings/usage use |
| Plan tier | `~/.claude.json` (`oauthAccount`) — local |
| Today's tokens + per-session tokens | `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` — local (transcript entries joined to sessions by `sessionId`) |

The usage call reuses your existing local OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` as a
Bearer token to read **your own** usage. The token is read locally and sent only to
`api.anthropic.com` — never stored, logged, or sent anywhere else. The API is polled about
once a minute; the countdown ticks locally in between. If the API is unreachable, the
extension falls back to a local estimate from your transcripts (marked `*`/`~`) and the
dropdown status line shows the error.

## Troubleshooting

- **Don't see it after installing?** You must reload the shell (see [Install](#install)).
  Then check it's on: `gnome-extensions info claude-usage@aidan.local`.
- **Usage shows `n/a` or a `⚠` error?** Make sure Claude Code is signed in. A red
  `HTTP 429` just means the API is rate-limiting — it recovers on its own.
- **Watch for errors while it runs:** `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep -i claude-usage`
